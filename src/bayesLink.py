        import tucker's algo, and update within the xml for the comms network
        create lea bool value for that
        [not yet capable] import the adversary risk value from davids alorithm
        to manually modify tuckers algorithm, values can be placed in a text file and imported
        same for David's
        both david and tucker's algo will be first two nodes, of boolean value
        then boolean node for adversary monitoring(fed by adversary capabilites and time of day), followed by comms detected node.
        This feeds to comms IDed as subversive, with another input of amount of similar traffic (high, medium, low may be best)
        this breaks into risk value
        question remains: how to display the value
